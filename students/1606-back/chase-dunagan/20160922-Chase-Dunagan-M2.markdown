# Chase Dunagan - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I want to learn all the new frameworks and tools that are being taught to us, in order to be a better programmer. I want to make sure I spend at least 2 hours each night, studying the new content and trying to get ahead on projects and tutorials, instead of falling behind. I want to make sure I understand everything I'm learning to my fullest capibilities. If I don't understand something, I want to make sure I do research and then ask questions. I feel like I'm starting this mod near the bottom of the cohort, and I want to end this mod feeling like I've "caught up" to others and maybe even surpassed others in their understanding of the material.

### A: End of Module Assessment

Notes from Sal

* Good understanding in conceptual portion. Could benefit from slightly stronger knowledge of the URI patterns and MVC.
* Initial instinct was to create a new test rather than modify existing that had substantially similar functionality.
* Some prompting to get to the controller/check for strong params when name wasn't saving.
* Got a little bit in your own head when trying to implement the second story. Write the test! Let's go from there.
* In the test, created level and went straight to implementing a visit without creating actual tasks.
* When creating an attempt put colons on wrong side for hash syntax/didn't use hash rockets.
* Needed some prompting to get to the idea of using byebug in the show method in the LevelsController.
* Initial instinct was to reach for Level in the Level model when creating a new method to access attempts.

### Rails Mini Project - IdeaBox

* [Github Url](https://github.com/Cdunagan05/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

I did not finish Ideabox to the full extent that I had hoped to.  I ran into time issues that stemmed from my previous scheduling conflicts. Although I did not finish Idea Box, I still received valuable learning from it, which included authenticating a user, and increasing my ability to crud in rails.  I would like to go back and finish Idea Box at a later time, in order to fully gain the knowledge that this miniproject has to offer.

####6: View Layer: 2.5

Feedback from Sonia
---- Chase is such a huge asset to the Turing community. When the basement seems dark and foreboding, and the code seems overwhelming, Chase steps in and offers incredible perspective, optimism, and insight. I think our Rush Hour team actually really enjoyed the work, and that is largely due to Chase’s influence. When you take an amazingly bright personality and thoughtful nature and mix it with dedication and hard work, you’ve got a recipe for a fantastic programmer. That, right there, is Chase.

Feedback from Jasmin
---- Chase acted as the glue that held our Rush Hour group together when we needed it the most. He is an awesome diplomat that makes sure everyone has their voice heard. I am fortunate to have gotten to work with him this module and value his friendship tremendously. While he definitely has coding chops, he does sometimes become quiet and turn inward when he’s contemplating solutions to issues and it would have made me feel more aware of his feelings if he voiced them out loud during Rush Hour. Besides that, he’s an asset to any team he is on.

### Little Shop of Orders

* [Github Url](https://github.com/Cdunagan05/little_shop)
* [Heroku Url](https://safe-shore-68034.herokuapp.com/)

Our Little Shop was a website that sold college apparel such as Jerseys, Waterbottles, etc. In this app, we implemented tons of basic website functionality, as well as authorization and authentication functionality. Little shop was an extremely enjoyable experience, and my first project in which I felt like a true web developer.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

There were many different kinds of gear-ups this mod, and I would like to say that they all resonated with me, equally, but I have to admit that I had a couple of favorites.  I liked the gear up about learning, and how we can get really good at something by learning in a specific manner (intense studying for a short amount of time).  And I loved the gear up about the Debugging the Gender Gap.  The documentary wa outstanding, but I really enjoyed talking to the girls in the room where they were sharing their personal experiences about sexism in the workplace.  It really made me appreciate what my sister probably went through and goes through every day, being a lawyer.  Not only does she not want to succeed for herself, but she also probably feels the weight of succeding for the sake of all other women who want to be lawyers.  Having that thought constantly on her mind, must be a lot to bear, and I'm extremely proud of what she has done in her life.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/Cdunagan05/bd6d6decb70b0857528237324ff13e38)

I feel like I would have gotten more out of this lesson if I had thought more about where I wanted to work, and what type of company I would want to work for, bec=fore the lesson. We spent a lot of time going over our social media presence, which was very helpful.  I will definitely use some of the pointers gained from that lesson, in the future. 

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?
 
I really loved the idea of forming a bond within the group, in order to get out of the storming stage, and into the performing stage, so I used that often.  Something that didn't go well was direct communication, because even though it sounds great in theory, in practice, some people do not take too kindly to it. 

2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.

I have tried to work on any feedback my team memebers have given me, but I think that I've learned that just knowing about your issues, does not neccessarily mean that you can fix them easily. Sometimes your issues may lie deaper than just changing the way you talk to someone or interact with them.  It may be something that is just so much part of your personailty, that changing that part of you will take lots and lots of time and effort.  I have learned this about myself, and I have started working on it, because you cannot begin to change something until you start to change something. 

#### Networking with Lia

This networking class was fun, and really brought out some of my unknown flaws in networking.  I realized that my networking skills were lacking in certain areas, and this lesson gave me the opportunity to see that, so I may work on it in the future.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Sonia 
----Sonia was a terrific partner on Rush Hour.  Our group clicked well from the start, and I think that’s in large part to Sonia’s special ability to be so considerate to the people she works with.  Her coding ability is much much better than she gives herself credit for, and her ideas are unique and fruitful. I enjoyed working with Sonia very much, and I hope to work with her again in the future.  If I had one critique, it would be that Sonia believed in her abilities more.  She's extremely smart, and that shows anytime you talk to her.  Without her great ideas, our Rush Hour project would have been very different, and I am extremely thankful for them.  Sonia is awesome, and it’s hard to put into words how happy I am that she is in our cohort, now.

Feedback to Jasmin
----Jasmin was an incredible partner to have on our Rush Hour project.  Not only was she extremely capable and an outstanding project manager, but she was also amazing to be around and work with, for multiple days in a row.  She did a great job as our project manager at keeping us on track and organizing our waffle board, but that doesn’t compare to how valuable she was in terms of actual coding.  Jasmin is one of those rare people who can be so intelligent, yet funny, and incredibly kind, all at once.  I’m so glad she’s part of our cohort and I had the pleasure of working with her on Rush Hour.

### Playing a Part

- Talked to multiple Turing applicants and potential Turing students, at the request of Erin. 
- Mentored a Mod 1 student, mostly emotionally, at the request of Beth.
- Attended Productivity lunches and Imposter lunches. 
- Helped organize the big workspace every friday, in preparation for the speaker/gear-ups.
